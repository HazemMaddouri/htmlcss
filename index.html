            <p>In nature, <tag class="good">Good</tag> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <tag class="good">good</tag> nor <tag class="bad">bad</tag>, but a potential in permanent development.</p>

<p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that 
rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing 
cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s 
no such thing as an issue.</p>

    <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing 
exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our 
senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we miss sense, our 
reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you
 can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, 
our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes 
depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, 
everything’s fake.</p>
    
    <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see 
that person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine 
falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.
 But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything 
works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that 
you passively do it anyway.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran 
away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
They said, <tag class="villageois">"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate."</tag> </p>

        <p>The farmer said, <tag class="fermier">"Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know."</tag> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <tag class="villageois">"Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!"</tag> The farmer again said, <tag class="fermier">"Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know."" </tag></p>

         <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, 
and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then
 said, <tag class="villageois">"Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>,"</tag> and the farmer responded, <tag class="fermier">"Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know."</tag>
 The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people 
into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
Again all the neighbors came around and said, <tag class="villageois">"Isn’t that great!"</tag> Again, he said, <tag class="fermier">"Is it <tag class="good">good</tag>? Is it <tag class="bad">bad</tag>? I don't know."</tag></p>

         <blockquote>
            <q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of 
immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything 
that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.</q><br>Alan

    <p><tag class="good">Good</tag> and <tag class="bad">Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag class="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="good">good</tag> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
